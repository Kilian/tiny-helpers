# Thank you for opening a pull request to tiny-helpers.dev ❤️

Before you submit your PR, please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/stefanjudis/tiny-helpers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). :)

To make it easier for us to review and merge your PR, please make sure …

- [ ] you only add one (!) new helper per pull request.
- [ ] you have checked if an open PR already exists.
- [ ] the submitted website is focused on a single, development related issue.
- [ ] the `desc` field includes an "actionable sentence" (e.g. "Create something great" or "Transform something into something else").
- [ ] the `maintainers` are valid GitHub user names

🚨 **If you don't follow these rules or didn't tick the checkboxes, I'll close your PR immediately.** This might seem harsh, but the amount of "useless" PRs sneaking into my notifications is more than I want to tolerate.

Thank you! 🙇‍♂️
